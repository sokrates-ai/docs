#  Infrastructure Overview

LearnHouse is separated into two parts/codebases :

- **Frontend** : Web interface for the user to interact with the application, some parts are server rendered and some are client rendered, we use React Server Components enabled by Next.js 14

- **Backend** : Backend code in Python using FastAPI that handles : Storage, Authentication, Uploads, AI etc. 

Here is a diagram that explains the infrastructure in a simple way to get started :
